= Rio - Ruby I/O Facilitator

fa-cil-i-tate:  To make easy or easier 

Rio is a facade for most of the standard ruby classes that deal with
I/O; providing a simple, intuitive, succinct interface to the
functionality provided by IO, File, Dir, Pathname, FileUtils,
Tempfile, StringIO, OpenURI and others. Rio also provides an
application level interface which allows many common I/O idioms to be
expressed succinctly.

==== Building the documentation

To create the documentation for Rio run the command
  ruby build_doc.rb
from the distribution directory.

Then point your browser at the 'doc/rdoc' directory.

The RDoc template file included with this distribution contains some
RDoc hacks that overcomes some of RDoc's weaknesses and makes the
documentation *much* more usable. It is inadvisable to build the RDoc
documentation without these.


===== Suggested Reading

* RIO::Doc::SYNOPSIS
* RIO::Doc::INTRO
* RIO::Doc::HOWTO
* RIO::Doc::EXAMPLES
* RIO::Rio
